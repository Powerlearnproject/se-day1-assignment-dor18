Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Sotware engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.it involves software product design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C).
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements: This is the phase of gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design: creating a high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation: writing code and building software according to the design specifications.
4. Testing: conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment: This is where the software is released to users or customers.
6. Maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates and enhancement to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The WATERFALL has a Sequential approach with distinct phases while the AGILE has an  iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
The Agile can be used to get feedbacks from customer and responding to it while the Water Fall can be used to gather and document users needs and system requirements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test.
3. Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code.
2. Version Systems Control(VCS) provides tools tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.
Examples:
1. IDEs: Visual Studio, Eclipse etc
2. VCS: Git, Subversion etc.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges:
1. Changing Requirements
2. Technical debt
3. Tight deadlines
Strategies:
1. Effective communication
2. Agile methodologies
3. Prioritization of tasks
4. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing involves testing individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration Testing involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. Systems Testing involves testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance Testing involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Engineering ia the process of crafting your questions and instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from AI models. Prompt engineering helps get good responses from AI models instead of confusing answers.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: what are values?
Improved prompt: Give the full details of values by defining and stating the types, examples, sources and factors that influences values.
The improved prompt is more effective because it is clear and specific unlike the vague prompt that only asked for the meaning or values.
